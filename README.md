Some terrible scripts to make a pretty lame analysis information management system for my use.

Things that would make this less terrible:

+ [ ] Tests
+ [x] Factoring out the database models to models class
+ [x] Making this installable
+ [x] pulling preprocess script logic into modules to be imported
* [ ] refactoring the build38realignment directory to use the directory validator
